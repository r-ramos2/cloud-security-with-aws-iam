## Introducing Today's Project!

In this project, I will demonstrate how to secure AWS resources using IAM. I'm doing this project to learn how to create and manage EC2 instances, IAM users, groups, and policies to control access and build a strong foundation in cloud security.

### Tools and concepts

Services I used were AWS IAM and EC2. Key concepts I learned include user permissions, policy conditions, tagging for access control, and managing users through groups for scalable, secure access management.

### Project reflection

This project took me approximately one hour. The most challenging part was testing access restrictions correctly. It was most rewarding to see my IAM policy work as expected, blocking and allowing access where intended.

## Tags

Tags in AWS are labels that help organize resources. They make it easier to manage, search, and apply settings like permissions or billing across multiple resources by using consistent tag key-value pairs.

The tag I’ve used on my EC2 instances is called "Env". The value I’ve assigned for the production instance is "production", and for the development instance, it is "development". This helps clearly separate their purposes and manage them accordingly.

## IAM Policies

IAM Policies are documents that define permissions for AWS resources. They control what actions users or services can perform, on which resources, and under what conditions.

### The policy I set up

For this project, I’ve set up a policy using the JSON editor to directly define precise access rules for the development instance.

I’ve created a policy that allows full EC2 access only to instances tagged with "Env = development", allows read-only access for all EC2 resources, and explicitly denies tag creation or deletion across all resources.

### When creating a JSON policy, you have to define its Effect, Action and Resource.

The Effect determines if an action is allowed or denied, the Action specifies what operations can be performed (e.g., starting an EC2 instance), and the Resource defines which AWS resources the policy applies to.

## Account Alias

An account alias is a user-friendly name for your AWS account that replaces the default account ID in the login URL. It makes accessing the AWS Management Console easier and more memorable for users.

Creating an account alias took me... Now, my new AWS console sign-in URL is...

## IAM Users and User Groups

### Users

IAM users are individual accounts within AWS that represent people or services that need access to AWS resources. Each IAM user has specific permissions and credentials to access AWS services.

### User Groups

IAM user groups are collections of IAM users that allow you to manage permissions for multiple users at once by attaching policies to the group. This simplifies access management for users with similar roles.

I attached the policy I created to this user group, which means all users in this group will have the same permissions, specifically access to the development EC2 instance, ensuring consistent access settings.

## Logging in as an IAM User

There are two ways to share a new user's sign-in details. First, you can share the IAM user's sign-in URL and their username and password directly. Second, you can send the sign-in details through an email generated by AWS.

Once I logged in as my IAM user, I noticed some dashboard panels showed "Access Denied." This was because the permissions assigned to the IAM user were limited to specific resources, like the development instance, and excluded other areas.

## Testing IAM Policies

I tested my JSON IAM policy by attempting to stop both the production and development EC2 instances using the intern IAM user.

### Stopping the production instance

When I tried to stop the production instance, I received an error message stating that I wasn't authorized. This is because the IAM policy restricts access to the production instance, allowing only actions on instances with the "developmement" tag.

## Testing IAM Policies

### Stopping the development instance

Next, when I tried to stop the development instance, the action was successful. This was because the policy allows full EC2 access, but only for instances tagged with "Env = development".
